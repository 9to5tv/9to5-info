      Coming soon from <span class="n9to5">9to5</span>. A suite of tools that will make viewer interaction with the livestream a cinch to program. One of the main focuses of <span class="n9to5">9to5</span> projects is a user provided <span class="n9to5">input</span> translating to a project or artist <span class="n9to5">output</span>. With that in mind, our team is attempting to simplify the process for any developer or artist looking to program an <span class="n9to5">output</span> by pre-developing a set of <span class="n9to5">inputs</span>. Chat and social are already implemented thanks to streaming partner Maestro, and now the <span class="n9to5">9to5</span> team is focusing on more experimental methods of interaction.</p>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s how they work:
      <br />1. The artist determines what <span class="n9to5">output</span> they&rsquo;d like to see, like the dimming of a lightbulb.
      <br />2. Artist selects their <span class="n9to5">input</span> from the suite of tools, such as &ldquo;click and drag&rdquo;.
      <br />3. Because <span class="n9to5">9to5</span> has already developed the <span class="n9to5">input</span>, the artist only needs to plug our &ldquo;click and drag&rdquo; tool into their &ldquo;dimmer&rdquo; <span class="n9to5">output</span>.
