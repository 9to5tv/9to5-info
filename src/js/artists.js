    projectDescription: [
      `Holypager is a system that intercepts all POCSAG pager messages in the city it resides and forwards them to one (holy) pager. The installation anonymizes all messages and forwards them randomly to one of three pagers on display. Each message is also printed on a contiguous role of receipt paper amassing a large pile of captured pages for gallery goers to peruse.`,
      `Pagers use an outdated protocol that requires all messages to be broadcast unencrypted to each pager in the area. It is the role of the individual pager to filter and display only the messages intended for its specific address. The pagers below have been reprogrammed to ignore this filter and receive every message in the city in real time. Today, these devices are primarily used in hospitals to communicate highly sensitive information between doctors and hospital staff.`,
      `Given the severity of the HIPPA Privacy Act, one would assume that appropriate measures would be taken to prevent this information from being publicly accessible to the general public. This project serves as a reminder that as the complexity and proliferation of digital systems increase the cultural and technological literacy needed to understand the safe and appropriate use of these systems often do not.`

    projectDescription: [
      `9to5 presents Kevin Siwoff’s Basix, a participatory, site-specific exhibition, consisting of an e-commerce marketplace (http://basix.world) where real goods can be purchased and delivered to the Basix Lockr, located at 9to5.tv‘s Atlanta gallery.  In Basix, Siwoff investigates the ubiquitous system by which consumer packaged goods are manufactured, purchased, shipped, and unboxed.  He combines the banal utility of the web with the fetishism of the new, building on existing questions about the definition of the art object, and creating new ones about the definition of reality through the lens of live-streamed video and surrogate experience.`,
      `Visitors to basix.world are greeted—and their purchase decisions are often guided—by an atypical Customer Service Representative named Ahm.  Ahm is half artificially intelligent chatbot / half human, but unlike many of their predecessors in the world of “intelligent assistants”, Ahm is neither female nor male.  Ahm has flaws-- like occasional memory loss-- and Ahm also moonlights as an art advisor.`,
      `In addition to purchasing objects on basix.world, customers can watch live streamed videos of their purchases as they are unboxed by Basix staff members.  These videos, which play a large role in the gallery exhibition, follow specific unboxing rules predetermined by the artist.`,
      `The products available on Basix fall into 3 major categories: Ready-Used, Ready-Made, and Made to Order. The Ready-Used and Ready-Made objects are directly curated from products on existing e-commerce marketplaces like Amazon and Walmart.  Made to Order objects, on the other hand, are fabricated in the artist’s studio as well as in the gallery, and are cast in cling film plastic and tape—materials that evoke the packaging of objects, but not the objects themselves.  After the products are delivered and unboxed, the newly revealed forms are placed onto pedestals in the 9to5 gallery.`,
      `By elevating each consumer object, regardless of its artistic provenance, Basix not only questions the value and extent to which we define “art objects”, but also the absurd and often irresistible drive toward instantaneous mass consumption.`
